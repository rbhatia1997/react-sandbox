# Ronak Notes about Deployment

This project was created to showcase how to build React applications from the ground-up. The first "tutorial" website is available under "tutorial" and is a simple BookList application that includes information about Books. It is also available on the web [here](https://react-tutorial-test-application-isa.netlify.app/). It's hosted via Netlify, which allows free hosting via simply dragging and dropping the `build` folder that is created after `npm build.`
